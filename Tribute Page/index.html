            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam better known as A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, was the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. 
            A career scientist turned statesman, Kalam was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, and studied physics and aerospace engineering.
            He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and 
            Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.
            He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. 
            He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear 
            test by India in 1974.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress.
            Widely referred to as the "People's President," he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient 
            of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.
        </p>
        <p>
            While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. 
            Thousands including national-level dignitaries attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameshwaram, where he was buried with full state honours.

<p class="mb-0">"During his tenure as President of India, Kalam made it a priority to meet as many young people as possible one-to-one. He met almost a 
record-breaking target of 500,000 during his five-year term. When he left office in 2007, he was conferred a loving title of “Kalam Chacha” (“Uncle Kalam”
) because he would receive hundreds of emails a day from young people inspired by his encouragement to “dream, dream, dream!” He is reported to have 
replied in person to nearly all of them."</p>
